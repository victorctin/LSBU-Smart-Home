# ðŸ“¡ LSBU Smart Home Information System

This project is a prototype database and analytics solution developed for **LSBU Smart Home**, a company specializing in smart home technologies using Internet of Things (IoT) devices.

The solution simulates the companyâ€™s operational workflow including IoT sensor installations, building designs, inventory tracking, staff allocation, and client interactions. It covers full database lifecycle: from conceptual design to implementation and reporting.

## ðŸ“˜ Case Study Summary

LSBU Smart Home designs, installs, and maintains IoT-based smart home systems. The company:
- Serves multiple clients, each possibly owning or sharing multiple buildings.
- Installs a range of sensors and controllers (e.g., motion, smoke, HD-CCTV).
- Keeps logs of device compatibility, supplier inventories, and staff deployment.
- Plans to expand into remote control apps and cloud-based data management.
- Wants automated invoicing, smart analytics, and flexible payment systems.

## âœ… Key Features

- **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD):** Captures clients, buildings, designs, devices, suppliers, staff, and installations.
- **Normalization to 3NF/BCNF:** Ensures minimal redundancy and optimal structure.
- **SQL Implementation (MS SQL Server):** Creation of normalized tables and realistic test data (20+ records/table).
- **Advanced SQL Queries:**
  - Identify clients with highest/lowest design costs.
  - Analyze supplier order statuses (complete/incomplete/cancelled).
  - Check availability of specialist staff.
- **Stored Procedures & Triggers:**
  - Prevent double-bookings of staff.
  - Generate dynamic costed installation reports based on time filters (week/month/quarter).
- **Interactive Dashboard (Power BI):** Visualizes key metrics from the database (client activity, installation costs, staff assignments, etc.).

## ðŸ§ª Technologies Used

- **MS SQL Server** â€“ Relational database implementation
- **T-SQL** â€“ Queries, triggers, and stored procedures
- **Power BI** â€“ Business Intelligence dashboard
